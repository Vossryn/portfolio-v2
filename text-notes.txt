About Me
Hello there, people of the internet! I'm Britton Flynt, a passionate Full-stack JavaScript developer.

What I Do
I specialize in front-end working with ReactJS and CSS. Whether it's designing elegant user interfaces, writing efficient code, or creating captivating visual content, I thrive on turning ideas into reality. My journey began many years ago when I was taking general education courses in college and stumbled across a beginners HTML class. From that point on I was hooked on internet technologies and have been expanding my skills ever since.

My Approach
I believe in the power of simplicity and elegance. My work is a blend of creativity, functionality, and attention to detail. I'm constantly learning and experimenting, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. When I'm not coding or designing, you'll find me either hanging out with my family or off on my PC gaming. When I'm not doing those things I love to sit back and read everything from comics, webtoons, light novels and books or playing D&D things with my friends.

Why Work With Me?
Passion: I genuinely love what I do, and that passion reflects in my work.
Collaboration: I enjoy collaborating with fellow creatives and problem-solvers.
Results-Driven: I focus on delivering results that exceed expectations.
Continuous Growth: Learning is a lifelong journey, and I embrace it wholeheartedly.
